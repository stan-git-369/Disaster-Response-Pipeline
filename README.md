## Disaster Response Pipeline Project
# Project Description

In this project, we will build a model to classify messages that are sent during disasters. Initially we have 36 pre-defined categories, and examples of these categories include Aid Related, Medical Help, Search And Rescue, etc. By classifying these messages, we can allow these messages to be sent to the appropriate disaster relief agency. This project will involve the building of a basic ETL and Machine Learning pipeline to facilitate the task. This is also a multi-label classification task, since a message can belong to one or more categories. We will be working with a data set provided by Figure Eight containing real messages that were sent during disaster events.

Finally, this project contains a web app where you can input a message and get classification results.
